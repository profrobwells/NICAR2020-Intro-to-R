# NICAR2020-Intro-to-R

This is the repository for an R class at the NICAR Conference in New Orleans, March 7, 2020. 

This three-part course will be taught by [Meghan Hoyer](https://github.com/meghanhoyer), [Sean Mussenden](https://github.com/smussenden) and [Ryan Thornburg](https://github.com/rtburg/)

We’ll introduce you to R, a free, powerful open-source programming language that will take your data reporting to the next level. By the end of this three-hour session, you will be able to read data from common file types into R, clean and explore it, create visualizations, and make your entire data workflow reproduceable. We’ll also talk about how to find help when you’re stuck.
